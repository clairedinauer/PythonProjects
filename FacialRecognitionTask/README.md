 ## The Task

 In one half of this task, you will be required to learn a set of novel faces.
 After learning the faces, you will be asked to determine whether or not you had
 seen that face in the learning section of the task.

 In the other half of this task, you will be required to learn a set of novel images.
 After learning the image, you will be asked to determine whether or not you had
 seen that image in the learning section of the task.


 ## Included Files
 The "Faces" folder holds all of the images to be displayed during the task.
