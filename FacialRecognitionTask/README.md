 ## INTRODUCTION
 ------------
 Welcome to our Face Manipulation Recognition Task!
 
 The experimenters are Claire Dinauer and Nikka Mel Ruelos.

 In one half of this task, you will be required to learn a set of novel faces.
 After learning the faces, you will be asked to determine whether or not you had
 seen that face in the learning section of the task.

 In the other half of this task, you will be required to learn a set of novel images.
 After learning the image, you will be asked to determine whether or not you had
 seen that image in the learning section of the task.


 ## INCLUDED FILES
 ------------
 The "Faces" folder holds all of the images to be displayed during the task.

 The Dinauer_Ruelos.py file holds the script for the experiment.

 To run the experiment, type the following into your terminal:

                    python Dinauer_Ruelos.py

 Ensure that the Faces folder and Dinauer_Ruelos.py file are in the same path
 in order to successfully run the experiment.
