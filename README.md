## FacialRecognitionTask Folder
This folder contains my final project for my cognitive science laboratory, in which I collaborated with Nikka Mel Ruelos to create a face recognition experiment with signal detection theory.

Previous literature suggests that people can to recognize and reconstruct faces to a respectable degree when viewing them with occlusions, in different lighting, from different angles, when slightly blurred, and in different contexts. Hence, we decided to ask to what extent is recognition impaired when the image of a face distorted? And how may the amount of distortion impact later recognition? And, are we more likely to recognize the distorted face or a more “normal” face?

Paired-sample t-tests and a two-way within-subjects ANOVA were conducted to evaluate our results.
